The main pathways stimulated by the EGFR are the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–AKT, and signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STAT), such as STAT3 [27]. In addition, the activation of STAT3 also relies on the recruitment of the Src kinase to the EGFR [28], [29]. Upon nuclear translocation, the STAT3 transcription factor up-regulates several genes involved in cell cycle progression [30], [31], cell survival [32] and metastasis [33]. Another molecule of EGFR signaling cascade RAF1 protein, can phosphorylate to activate the dual specificity protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn phosphorylate to activate the serine/threonine specific protein kinases, ERK1 and ERK2. These key molecules of EGFR signaling MEK1, RAF1, STAT3 and PI3K were downregulated in hUCBSC treated glioma cells (Fig. 7G). Quantitative analysis shows that both RAF1 and PI3k (p<0.01) show significant downregulation compared to MEK1 and STAT3 (p<0.05) (Fig. 7H). We also checked the expression of these molecules in hUCBSC-treated glioma tumors in vivo and observed that these EGFR signaling molecules are downregulated compared to untreated tumors (Fig. 7I).

It is induced when the ER failed in maintaining cellular homeostasis, which is caused by constantly exposure to both intrinsic stresses like genomic instability, increased metabolic burden, oncogene expression, and extrinsic stresses, such as hypoxia, oxidative stress, and nutrient deprivation (Wang et al., 2010a). Cancer cells usually have stronger ability in protein synthesis and folding by inducing UPR through the activation of ER transmembrane protein sensors (Roy and Kumar, 2019). The UPR related proteins, such as protein kinaseR–like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1a (IRE1α), binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP/GRP78) and transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) could be suppressed to mitigate ER stress condition for cancer survival including GBM (Le Reste et al., 2016; Penaranda Fajardo et al., 2016; Madden et al., 2019). In addition, ER stress response in cancer is reported to act as a key driver in tumorigenesis and the development of resistance to chemotherapy or radiation via activation of UPR (Bahar et al., 2019). Therefore, we speculate that reduction of ER stress response may impair cellular homeostasis and lead to cell apoptosis, which might be an effective strategy for GBM therapy. Our results showed that the expression levels of PERK, IRE1α, BiP, and CHOP proteins were decreased dose-dependently in the treatment of NXD30001 alone or combined with radiation in GSCs, suggesting that NXD30001 could improve radiation sensitivity through impairing ER stress and cell survival response ultimately leading to GSCs death.', paperIds: 'PMC7338553'}]->(wtfcmqqj)

In contrast to many human tumours, RAS mutation is not common in human gliomas, with some exceptions such as cerebellar GBM [73]. Hyperactive RAS signalling alone is sufficient to generate gliomas that closely resemble human tumours in glioma mouse models. The RAS signalling pathway is therefore of central importance for human gliomagenesis. Primary GBMs are associated with impaired RAS signalling and expression of the oncogenic HRAS leads to a malignant phenotype in glioma cell lines [74, 75, 76, 77]. In particular, the KRAS oncogene is strongly involved in tumourigenesis in glioblastomas [75, 78, 79, 80], although KRAS mutations are almost absent in malignant gliomas [81]. Therefore, the observed deregulation of the Ras-RAF-ERK signalling pathway in gliomas is generally attributed to its upstream positive regulators, including EGFR and PDGFR, which are known to be highly active in many malignant gliomas [70]. It is likely that mechanisms other than mutations contribute to the activation of the RAS-MAPK signalling pathway in wild-type cancer. Indeed, epigenetic modifications have been described to enhance this activation in human tumours [82], and dysregulation of physiological miRNA activity has been shown to play an important role in gliomagenesis, but the functional significance of this regulatory level is currently unknown [11, 12, 75, 84, 85, 86, 87].', paperIds: 'PMC11026240'}]->(xoivzdhg)

This behavior together with the upregulation of PDGFRβ and CyclinD1 might be a cell modality to survive and adapt to molecular changes induced by depletion of Hes1 and, therefore escape from apoptosis.

It was originally observed that breast carcinoma invasion and metastasis is severely diminished in CSF-1 null (op/op) background mice [125]. Since that discovery, CSF-1 was shown to be associated with many malignant cancers and the establishment of a generally immunosuppressive microenvironment [126]. Our laboratory has shown that glioma cells express CSF-1 which results in TAM recruitment and the invasion of tumor cells into normal brain parenchyma [23,127,128]. The blockade of CSF-1R signaling with PLX-3397, a CSF-1R pharmacological inhibitor that crosses the blood–brain barrier, strongly attenuated invasion and was curative in some preclinical GBM models [23,129]. In the context of CSF-1R contribution to the phagocytic checkpoint, the balance of evidence points to an important role for CSF-1R signaling to rearrange actin during the various stages of phagocytosis [130]. Recently, it was demonstrated that GW2580, another pharmacological inhibitor of CSF-1R, induced MHC-II expression, phagocytosis, and the T-cell-mediated killing of GBM tumors in patient-derived 3D organoid models [131]. Interestingly, PLX3397 did not display these features. This discrepancy is likely because these inhibitors hit different off-target RTKs [132,133]. Under standard conditions, CSF-1 is released by cancer cells as a soluble ligand which acts on macrophages via the CSF-1R in a paracrine and possibly endocrine fashion [134]. However, it was discovered that there is a splice variant of the CSF-1 gene which contains a transmembrane domain and results in a surface membrane bound form of CSF-1, referred to as mM-CSF [78]. Interestingly, glioma cells expressing mM-CSF are highly susceptible to phagocytosis and cytotoxic killing by TAMs [78,79,80]. The mechanism is unclear; however, the membrane-bound mM-CSF is functional as it has the ability to stimulate macrophage colony formation [78].

The Leucine-Rich Repeats and Ig-Like Domain (LRIG) family of transmembrane receptors has been associated with neurological tumors [113,114]. There are three LRIG genes in humans and they primarily regulate growth factor receptors by targeting them for ubiquitination. In glioma cells, LRIG1 and 3 act as tumor suppressors, while LRIG2 has a seemingly oncogenic function [113,115,116]. A recent study by Hu et al. showed that LRIG2 can strongly prevent the phagocytosis of GBM cells by upregulating components of the CD47 pathway [117]. In this report, soluble LRIG2 generated by A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17)-mediated cleavage from GBM cells was shown to recruit TAMs and induce SIRPa expression on their surface. In addition to this, LRIG2 was shown to enhance the expression of CD47 on GBM cells via transcriptional activation of the CD47 gene. This study strongly implicates LRIG2 as a key regulator of the CD47 immune checkpoint via the upregulation of both CD47 and SIRPa. The well-characterized beta-catenin oncogenic pathway can also stimulate CD47 expression in GBM cells [118]. Another study demonstrates how the EGFR pathway cooperates with CD47 to promote tumor progression. EGFR is commonly altered in GBM, although single agent therapy with EGFR inhibitors have displayed modest efficacy at best [119]. In a recent study, EGF treatment or expression of the constitutively active truncation mutant EGFRvIII was able to increase the expression of CD47 in multiple established human GBM cell lines [120]. This effect was found to be mediated by SRC phosphorylation of CD47 at Y288 which prevents binding and polyubiquitination by Tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. GBM cells expressing a CD47 Y288F mutant are phagocytosed in vivo at much higher levels, and animals orthotopically injected with these cells survive longer than wild-type injected counterparts.', paperIds: 'PMC11352848'}]->(dqjbshnq)

During the formation of NS, the adaptive molecular landscape of the transcriptome, which includes various regulatory RNAs, changes. The aim of this study was to reveal changes in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target mRNAs in GBM cells under conditions of NS formation. Neurospheres were obtained from both immortalized U87 MG and patient-derived BR3 GBM cell cultures. Next generation sequencing analysis of small and long RNAs of adherent and NS cultures of GBM cells was carried out. It was found that the formation of NS proceeds with an increase in the level of seven and a decrease in the level of 11 miRNAs common to U87 MG and BR3, as well as an increase in the level of 38 and a decrease in the level of 12 mRNA/lncRNA.

Most recently, wild-type EGFR has been shown to phosphorylate EGFRvIII, leading to phosphorylation of STAT proteins and progression in tumorigenesis [22]. In the earlier part of the study, we showed that combined treatment is effective in Asian glioma cells expressing wild-type EGFR; herein, we sought to determine whether the combination of Nimotuzumab and rapamycin may also be effective in mutant EGFRvIII-expressing human glioma cells. For this, human U87MG glioma cells overexpressing wild-type EGFR (U87MG.wtEGFR; 170 kDa) and mutant EGFRvIII (U87MG.EGFRvIII, 145 kDa), as validated by western blot analysis (Figure 3A), were used.

In these glioma cells expressing either wt or EGFRvIII receptor, elevated cell death observed in the Nimotuzumab group correlated with reduced levels of activated AKT in both cell types (Figure 3D), providing further support that Nimotuzumab acts regardless of EGFR status. U87MG.EGFRvIII has lower percentage of viable cells in comparison to U87MG.wtEGFR, suggesting that EGFRvIII-positive human glioma cells were less resistant to TMZ compared to their wtEGFR counterpart.

The reported protein half-life of VEGFR2 in endothelial (HUVEC) cells was considerably longer (70 min) compared with 42 min in our experiments with GSCs (unpublished data). Even more striking, however, is the contrasting impact of proteasome inhibition on VEGFR2 protein abundance. Thus, for endothelial cells Meissner et al. (2009) reported that diverse proteasome inhibitors (including MG132) blocked VEGFR2 expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and decreased VEGFR2 protein levels were paralleled by impaired formation of capillary-like structures and endothelial cell migration (Meissner et al., 2009). In sharp contrast, we observed that in VEGFR2L cell population, the VEGFR2 protein became stabilized and its levels increased already after a short-term exposure to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (unpublished data). For endothelial cells under hypoxia, Kremer et al. (1997) suggested a direct transcriptional induction of VEGF that subsequently evoked up-regulation of VEGFR2. In neural stem cells, expression of VEGFR2 is up-regulated by bFGF-evoked signaling via phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Xiao et al., 2007). We interpret these results as evidence for regulation of VEGFR2 in GSCs by rapid proteasome-mediated protein turnover, and indication that VEGFR2 is subject to highly flexible and prompt control that are broadly analogous to key regulators of the cell cycle and cell viability/death pathways (e.g., cyclins, NF-κB inhibitors, etc.).', paperIds: 'PMC3302235'}]->(kjxxkjph)

Thus, methylation changes in gene promoters seemed to be unrelated to aberrant copy number [70]. Our data show, for the first time to our knowledge, the genome-wide methylation profiles of the stem cell subpopulation of GBM. Analyzing the global GCI methylation content, GCSs and GBM FFPE tissues showed GCI hypomethylation compared to foetal NSCs isolated from the spinal cord (Figure 2).

A similar role for Notch1 activation was also observed in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutant diffuse low-grade gliomas [19]. These studies provided us with a specific molecular signature and a non-exhaustive list of transcription factors that potentially mediate the Notch1 downstream effects.

Earlier reports from our research group have shown that several alkylaminophenols functions as an inducer of apoptosis on osteosarcoma and GBM [25,26,27,28]. Although anticancer activity of phenolic derivatives has been well reported on various cancers, their effect on GBM is not well investigated. Hence, the present study is aimed at evaluating the effect of alkylaminophenols on GSC and non-stem cancer cells (NSCC) derived from two different GBM cell lines (LN229 and SNB19). The profound investigation on the cellular mechanisms has been performed, which revealed the cytotoxic effect of alkylaminophenols on GSC. The multiple patient-derived GBM cell lines were also used to further confirm the potential of the compound as an effective chemotherapeutic agent for GBM.', paperIds: 'PMC7140667'}]->(sjuwzvwi)

As expected, each cell line showed a certain degree of karyotype complexity which ranges from a high number of structural abnormalities, as the GBM2 cell line, to the presence of two subpopulations with a different modal number of chromosomes, as the G179 cell line (G179 and G179*). The modal number of chromosomes varied from near-diploid (G166, GliNS2), near-triploid (GBM2, G179), near-tetraploid (G144, GBM7), to near-pentaploid (G179*). All the chromosomes were involved in numerical alterations (Figure 1A): the most common (73% of the total analyzed metaphases) was gain of chromosome 7, with at least two supernumerary copies in four cell lines (GBM2, GBM7, G179 and G144, Table 1). Other commonly observed numerical changes were: loss of chromosome 13 (43%); loss or gain of chromosome X (28% or 21% of cases, respectively); loss of chromosome Y (39%); loss of chromosome 10 (in three out of six cell lines, frequency of 32%). A total of 59 different clonal chromosomal aberrations were found among the 6 cell lines. Chromosome 1 was the most involved in structural abnormalities: the ever present deletions in 1p36-1p33 were further accompanied by inversions or unbalanced translocations (Table 1 and Figures S2, S3, and S4). Also chromosomes 18, 11 (three out of six cell lines), 12 (four out of six cell lines) were frequently damaged by structural abnormalities. Finally, the long arm of chromosome 6 was affected by loss of genomic material in two cell lines (GBM2 and G166) or by two translocations, involving chromosome 7 (GBM2) or 3 (GliNS2). Lastly, by conventional cytogenetic techniques, it was possible to observe the presence of double minutes, which should not be included in the count of the number of chromosomes. The molecular karyotypes showed some common genomic features of GBM, such as complete loss (nullisomy) of 9p21.3 locus (GBM2, GBM7, G179 and GliNS2), containing CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes (Figure 1B and Tables S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6). Complete or nearly complete gain of chromosome 7 was evidenced in the same GSC lines, while for G166 cells gain of 7p22.3-q11.2, including EGFR, was observed (Figure 1B and Table S4). Loss of whole chromosome 10 in GBM7 and G179 cell lines led to the inevitable absence of PTEN and DMBT1 genes and the same alteration was obtained in GliNS2 cells through the loss of 10q21.3-q26.3 region (Table S6). Accordingly, loss of PTEN locus (10q23.31) resulted in the lack of detectable PTEN transcriptional expression in G179 and GliNS2 lines and slight expression in GBM7 cells. Considering the absence of genomic alterations at PTEN locus in GBM2 and G166 cell lines, the divergences in gene expression should be ascribed to differences in the methylation levels of PTEN promoter region: G166 cells revealed PTEN expression and lack of promoter methylation, while GBM2 cells displayed no PTEN expression and promoter methylation (Figure S5). Loss of whole chromosome 13, containing RB1 gene, was evidenced in 86% of GBM2 and 29% of G179 cells (Table S2 and S5, respectively). Several CNAs affected chromosome 1: whole p-arm loss nearly in 50% of G179 cells; 1p36-p34 loss in GBM7 and GliNS2 cell lines; 1q21.1-q32.2 gain in G166 (almost 90% of cells); in particular, gain of 1q32.1 locus, containing MDM4 gene, was found also in GBM2 cells. Other aberrations were: gain of 20p and 20q in GBM7 and G166 cells; loss of chromosome Y in four cell lines. In addition, “private” alterations were evidenced, such as the gain of whole chromosome X in G166 line, the amplification of 4q12, containing PDGFR and the loss of TP53 locus (17p13.2-p13.1) in almost 60% of cells in GBM2 line.', paperIds: 'PMC3585345'}]->(qhyqjitf)
